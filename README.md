aw-watcher-input
================

Track your keypresses and mouse movements with [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net).

NOTE: Work in progress, contributions welcome!

NOTE: This does not track *which* keys you press, only that you pressed any key some number of times in a given time span.


# Build

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and `poetry` installed, then install with `poetry install`.


# Usage

Run `aw-watcher-input --help` for usage instructions.

We might eventually create binary builds (like the ones bundled with ActivityWatch for aw-watcher-afk and aw-watcher-window) to make it easier to get this watcher up and running, but it's still a bit too early for that.
